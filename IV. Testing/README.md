Part IV. Testing 测试
========================
The adoption of the test-driven-development (TDD) approach to software development is certainly advocated by the Spring team, and so coverage of Spring’s support for integration testing is covered (alongside best practices for unit testing). The Spring team has found that the correct use of IoC certainly does make both unit and integration testing easier (in that the presence of setter methods and appropriate constructors on classes makes them easier to wire together in a test without having to set up service locator registries and suchlike)…​ the chapter dedicated solely to testing will hopefully convince you of this as well.
